## üî∞ Introduction
This repository documents my **Week 2 learning journey** and submissions for the **VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**.  

This week focuses on **BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling** for RISC-V SoC components.  

üí° The aim is to **learn ‚Üí implement ‚Üí verify ‚Üí document ‚Üí share**.

# Week 2 ‚Äì BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling

This week was dedicated to designing RTL modules, simulating and synthesizing them, and learning optimization techniques.

### üóìÔ∏è Daily Breakdown

| Tasks | Task Overview | Details & Documents |

### ‚úÖ Key Learnings from Week 2
- Designed basic **RTL modules** in Verilog.
- Performed **simulation using Icarus Verilog & GTKWave**.
- Synthesized RTL designs using **Yosys**.
- Understood **blocking vs non-blocking assignments** and their impact on simulation correctness.
- Learned **combinational and sequential optimization techniques** to reduce area and improve timing.
- Gained experience in **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** and identifying synthesis-simulation mismatches.
